      <h2>About Saf-T Child</h2>
      <div class="d-inline d-custom">
        <p>
          Saf-T Child is a child safety device that is designed to save a
          child's life in an emergency situation. Founded by Lorraine Forest
          after learning of a terrible accident, Saf-T Child is designed to
          ensure no child is left in a car, unattended, again. The device
          component sits discreetly underneath any carseat, and detects when a
          car is in motion and in use, or turned off and unattended. If a child
          is detected in a carseat inside of a car that is turned off for 60
          seconds, primary contacts are notified via an SMS text message. After,
          if the child is not moved to saafety, a larger range of secondary
          contacts are notified. If the child remains in the seat after a total
          3 minutes unattended, local emergency services are contacted.
